# TypeConversions
Code show how list initialisation works in C++ (showing different type conversions), code also shows how some of std::numeric_limits&lt;T> member functions works (epsilon(), round_error(), infinity()). Additionally there is also created generic function which accepts std::initializer_list&lt;T> args as an argument
